# Legal and Ethical Compliance

In cybersecurity, understanding the legal and ethical boundaries of testing and exploitation is essential. Penetration testers must comply with laws, policies, and contracts, and operate within clearly defined scopes of engagement.

This note covers core concepts from [[PenTest_Processes|penetration test processes]] and serves as foundational knowledge for any professional performing ethical hacking or working with a client environment.

## Core Concepts

### Authorization and Scope

- **Testing must be authorized** by written, signed agreement (e.g., [[Engagement_Contracts|engagement contracts]])
- Scope defines:
	- Which systems can be tested
	- Which methods are allowed
	- Timing and restrictions
- Operating outside the scope can lead to **civil or criminal liability**

### Due Care vs Due Diligence

- **Due Care**: taking reasonable steps to prevent harm (doing what's expected)
- **Due Diligence**: Actively identifying and managing risks
- Organizations must demonstrate both to avoid negligence

### Civil vs Criminal Law

- **Civil law**: Deals with private rights and disputes (e.g., contract violations)
- **Criminal law**: Covers illegal activity punishable by the state (e.g., unauthorized access)

## Key Terms

- **Informed Consent**: target organization understands risks and explicitly agrees to testing
- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**: Prevents disclosure of sensitive information during/after engagement
- **Hold Harmless Clause**: Protects tester from liability caused by unintended damage

These are typically documented in [[Engagement_Contracts|engagement contracts]] and must be reviewed before starting an assessment.

## Ethics in Cybersecurity

- Testing must prioritize **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**
- Follow professional codes of conduct (e.g., EC-Council, ISC2)
- Avoid conflicts of interest, coercion, or targeting non-consensual third parties

## Relevant Frameworks and Laws

| Area               | Examples                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Data Protection    | GDPR, HIPAA                          |
| Industry Standards | PCI-DSS, NIST, ISO 27001             |
| Cybercrime Laws    | CFAA (USA), Computer Misuse Act (UK) |

---

## Notes

- Always perform a legal review before starting any penetration test or vulnerability assessment
- Keep records of authorization, scope, and communications
- When in doubt, clarify before acting â€” even ethical actions can be misinterpreted without context
