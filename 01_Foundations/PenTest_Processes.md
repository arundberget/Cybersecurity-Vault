# Penetration Test Processes and Types

A penetration test (or pentest) is a simulated cyberattack used to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. Penetration testers must follow a structured methodology that ensures tests are legal, documented, and aligned with client goals. Testing is typically defined in advance through formal [[Engagement_Contracts|engagement contracts]] and must comply with applicable [[Legal_Ethical_Compliance|legal ethical compliance]] guidelines.

## Phases of a Penetration Test

The standard penetration test lifecycle includes the following key stages:

### Planning and Preparation

This phase sets the scope, rules of engagement, objectives, and legal boundaries for the test. Authorization, scheduling, and the designation of stakeholders are established here. Most legal protections stem from a properly scoped [[Engagement_Contracts|engagement contract]] document, and testing should not begin without one.

### Reconnaissance

During recon, testers collect information about the target using passive and active techniques. This may include open-source intelligence (OSINT), DNS interrogation. Tools used here often include WHOIS, search engine queries, enumeration frameworks. See the [[03_Reconnaissance/Process|reconnaissance process]] and [[03_Reconnaissance/Tools|reconnaissance tools]] for specific techniques.

### Scanning

Scanning identifies open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities using tools like [[Nmap]] or web scanners. This step transitions from intelligence-gathering into live interaction with systems, and serves as a bridge between [[03_Reconnaissance/Process|reconnaissance]] and exploitation.

### Gaining Access

Testers exploit known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to obtain unauthorized access. Techniques include password spraying, buffer overflows, SQL injection, and remote code execution. [[Metasploit]] is commonly used in this phase to deploy payloads and establish sessions.

### Maintaining Access

In this phase, testers attempt to stay inside the system, simulating real-world attackers. Persistence mechanisms may include backdoors, startup scripts, or scheduled tasks. This helps evaluate how well a blue team can detect long-term compromise. Related tactics align with [[MITRE_ATT&CK|MITRE ATT&CK]] techniques.

### Covering Tracks

Actions taken here include log tampering, clearing event histories, or hiding payloads. Though unethical in real operations, this phase helps simulate adversarial behavior and test forensic readiness.

### Reporting and Remediation

Findings are compiled into a report for stakeholders. This includes technical detail, risk scoring, exploit screenshots, and remediation steps. The final output may be used to support compliance efforts such as PCI-DSS, NIST 800-53, or ISO 27001.

## Types of Penetration Tests

Penetration tests can vary by perspective, access level, and goal:

- **External Testing** simulates attacks from outside the network perimeter.
- **Internal Testing** simulates insider threats or scenarios where an attacker already has access.
- **Blind Testing** means the tester has no information about the target.
- **Double-Blind Testing** means neither the tester nor the defenders know the timing or nature of the test.
- **Targeted Testing** is coordinated between attacker and defender to focus on specific objectives.
- **Web Application Testing** focuses on Layer 7 vulnerabilities
- **[[Overview|Social Engineering]] Tests** evaluate human risk via phishing, baiting, or impersonation ([[Techniques|see techniques]]).
- **Physical Security Tests** involve on-site access attempts, badge cloning, or tailgating ([[Attacks|see attacks]]).

## Notes

- Penetration testing is part of a broader set of [[Assessment_Types|assessment types]] used in risk evaluation.
- Tests should only be performed after legal approval, and only within clearly defined [[Engagement_Contracts|engagement contracts]].
- Deliverables should meet expectations for compliance frameworks and be reviewed with the client.
