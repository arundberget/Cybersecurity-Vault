# Assessment Types

Security assessments are used to evaluate an organization's infrastructure, policies, applications, and procedures to identify weaknesses and improve overall risk posture. While penetration testing is one well-known method, there are several assessment types used for different goals and stages of maturity.

Assessments are typically governed by signed documentation and must adhere to the legal and ethical boundaries already covered in your [[Engagement_Contracts|engagement contracts]] and [[Legal_Ethical_Compliance|legal & ethical compliance]] files.

## Common Types of Security Assessments

### Vulnerability Assessments

Vulnerability assessments are diagnostic scans that identify known weaknesses without exploiting them. These scans are usually performed using automated tools and provide a risk-based snapshot

### Penetration Testing

Penetration testing involves actively exploiting vulnerabilities to determine their real-world impact. It follows a structured lifecycle that includes reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting. Proper scope, authorization, and communication are essential throughout this process and are documented during the engagement phase.

### Compliance Assessments

Compliance assessments ensure that an organization meets required regulatory or industry-specific standards such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, or NIST 800-53. These assessments may include documentation reviews, interviews, technical checks, and external audits. They are not necessarily exploitative but do intersect with security operations.

### Red and Blue Team Exercises

Red team assessments simulate long-term, stealthy adversary behavior, while blue teams focus on detection and response. These exercises test both offensive and defensive capabilities and typically involve advanced tactics and cross-team collaboration. While structured differently, both red and blue exercises still require contracts and reporting similar to those used in formal testing processes.

## Assessment Comparison Table

| Assessment Type       | Exploitation Involved | Primary Purpose                     |
|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Vulnerability Scan     | No                     | Identify known security weaknesses   |
| Penetration Test       | Yes                    | Demonstrate exploitability           |
| Compliance Assessment  | No                     | Validate against regulatory standards|
| Red/Blue Team Exercise | Possibly               | Simulate adversarial behavior        |

## Notes

- Not all assessments are adversarial â€” some are regulatory, some are strategic
- Organizations often combine multiple assessment types to get complete visibility
- Testing must always follow approved legal agreements and documentation practices
