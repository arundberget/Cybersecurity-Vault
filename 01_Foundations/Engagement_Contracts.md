# Engagement Contracts

Engagement contracts are legal agreements that define the scope, rules, and limitations of a penetration test or other security assessment. They protect both the client and the tester by ensuring that all activities are pre-approved, properly documented, and legally defensible.

These contracts must be in place before any form of testing begins. Without proper documentation, even an ethical test can be considered unauthorized access under law, an issue outlined in [[Legal_Ethical_Compliance|legal & ethical compliance]].

## Key Components of an Engagement Contract

### Scope Definition

The contract must clearly define:
- What systems or applications are in scope (e.g., domains, IP ranges)
- What is explicitly out of scope (e.g., production systems, third-party apps)
- Approved techniques (e.g., phishing, physical intrusion)
- Testing schedule and time boundaries

Scope management ensures the tester operates within agreed limits and aligns directly with the planning phase in the [[PenTest_Processes|penetration test process]].

### Rules of Engagement

Operational boundaries are often detailed in this section:
- Time-of-day restrictions for active testing
- Rate-limiting to avoid denial of service
- Points of contact during incidents or outages
- Required reporting milestones and deliverables

These rules help reduce the risk of unintentional harm and miscommunication.

### Legal Safeguards

Contracts often include legal protections such as:
- **Hold Harmless Clauses**: Releases the tester from liability in case of unintended disruptions or damage
- **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)**: Prevents the disclosure of sensitive information learned during the test
- **Authorization to Test**: A formal, signed statement that grants permission for all activities described in the contract

These rules help reduce the risk of unintentional harm and miscommunication.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role         | Responsibilities                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tester       | Stay within scope, document actions, report findings clearly |
| Client       | Define scope, review documentation, provide contact channels |
| Stakeholders | Approve the contract and accept final deliverables           |

## Notes

- All parties should review and approve the contract before the test begins
- Any changes to scope or rules must be updated in writing and acknowledged by both sides
- Engagement contracts are often stored alongside related compliance documentation and risk assessments
