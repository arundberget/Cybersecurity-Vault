# üîê Cybersecurity Vault

This is my lifelong documentation vault for cybersecurity. It covers both

- üî¥ Offensive security (red team, pentesting, recon, CTFs)
- üîµ Defensive operations (SOC, blue team, IR, threat hunting)

Built using Markdown for compatibility with:
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (knowledge graph, notes)
- [Github](https://github.com/) (syncing, sharing, version control)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Why I'm using Markdown

- Fully cross-platform (Obsidian, VS Code, GitHub, mobile)
- Allows focus on **knowledge and clarity**
- Allows linking and tagging to **build a network of ideas**

---

## üí°Vault Goals

- Serve as a long-term **documentation and reference system**
- Organize structured, cross-linked knowledge for red and blue teams
- Provide quick access to concepts, tools, techniques, and procedures
- Stay GitHub-compatible while being optimized for Obsidian's graph view

## ‚ùóIn Progress

 This vault is still in development. As I study, train, and work, I'll continue adding new pages, tools, frameworks, and cheat sheets.
